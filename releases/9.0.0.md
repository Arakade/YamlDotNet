# Release 9.0.0

## Breaking changes

- `SequenceStyle` and `MappingStyle` were moved to the `YamlDotNet.Core` namespace, for consistency with `ScalarStyle`.
- Duplicate keys are now an error, as per the [specification](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#mapping).
- TODO: Review all breaking changes
